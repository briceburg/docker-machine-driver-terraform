# docker-machine-driver-terraform

A driver for Docker Machine that uses Terraform to provision infrastructure.



## Installing the driver

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/tintoy/docker-machine-driver-terraform/releases) and place the provider executable in the same directory as `docker-machine` executable (or somewhere on your `PATH`).

## Building the driver

If you'd rather run from source, simply run `make install` and you're good to go.
